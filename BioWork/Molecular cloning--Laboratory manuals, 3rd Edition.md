# Choosing an Appropriate Strain of E. coli

Most investigators want to use strains of E. coli that are easy to transform with plasmid DNA (e.g., DH1 or MM294; for a full list of useful strains, please see Appendix 3). The vast majority of 
colEl-type plasmids introduced into these strains replicate to high copy number and can be isolated in high yield. However, a significant minority of recombinant plasmids transform strains of 
E. colt such as DH1 and MM294 with low efficiency, generate transformed colonies that are smaller than usual, and produce low yields of plasmid DNA. Most of these "difficult" plasmids can be 
shown to encode a protein that is toxic to E. coli or to contain inverted or repeated DNA 
sequences.

## INTRODUCTION



## PROTOCOLS



### 1  Construction of cDNA Libraries

This traditional protocol is based on the Gubler-Hoffman method(1983) and is divided into six stages:

*   Stage 1: Synthesis of First-strand cDNA Catalyzed by Reverse Transcriptase
*   Stage 2: Second-strand Synthesis
*   Stage 3: Methylation of cDNA
*   Stage 4: Attachment of Linkers or Adaptors
*   Stage 5: Fractionation of cDNA by Gel Filtration through Sepharose CL-4B
*   Stage 6: Ligation of cDNA to Bacteriophage λ Arms
*   Alternative Protocol: Ligation of cDNA into a Plasmid Vector
*   Additional Protocol: Amplification of cDNA Libraries

### 2  Construction and Screening of Eukaryotic Expression Libraries



Stage 1: Construction of cDNA Libraries in Eukaryotic Expression Vectors 11.68 
Stage 2: Screening cDNA Libraries Constructed in Eukaryotic Expression Vectors 11.74 





### 3  Exon Trapping and Amplification



Stage 1: Construction of the Library 11.81 
Stage 2: Electroporation of the Library into COS-7 Cells 11.85 
Stage 3: Harvesting the mRNA 11.87 
Stage 4: Reverse Transcriptase-PCR 11.89 
Stage 5: Analysis of Clones 11.95 





### 4  Direct Selection of cDNAs with Large Genomic DNA Clones
